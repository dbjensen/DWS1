		<h1>Heading Example</h1>
		<p>I have never meet my best friend face to face but I know him and trust him as I would even though we have never spoken face to face.  I feel that it is important to notice the fact that having friends in whom to trust can even be based on digital social media.  I never thought that friends could be as I have seen.  I know of the flaws and he knows of mine.  There is an understanding and mutual agreement that we will be professional with each other and with others.  There are many things that I have learned from him that have been enormous aiding aspects to my transition from being a Soldier to being a civilian.  Yes my wife has aided me as well but she by default has been in the army with me because she is my wife.  She has stood by my through thick and thin and I know that she hurts because of me.  Not just in the lack of my husband skills but also in my lack of becoming normal.  My mental pains are her pains too.
